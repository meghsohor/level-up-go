# 02. Slow Down

In this challenge, we need to implement a solution that will take a string as input and return a prolonged version of each word.

By **prolonging**, it means to repeat each letter by it's index number + 1. The number of repetitions should reset at the start of each word.

### Example:

```JavaScript
Input: "Go Time!"
Output: "Goo Tiimmmeeee!!!!!"
```

### This challenge requires:

- Use of `Split` and `Join` functions from `string` package
