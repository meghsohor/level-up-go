# 01. Sleeps until your birthday

In this challenge, we have to implement a solution that will take a date as input from the users and return the remaining number of days before their next birthday.

This challenge requires:

- Taking user input for their date of birth using `flag` package
- Validating the date and calculating the remaining day using `time` package
